# Becoming an Expert in Physics Without University
## Books to Read

1. **Mathematics**

    To understand the language of physics, you will need a solid foundation in mathematics. We recommend these books:

    - _Calculus: A Complete Course_ by Robert A. Adams and Chris Essex
    - _Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction_ by David Poole
    - _Introduction to Differential Equations_ by Richard Haberman
    - _Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences_ by Mary L. Boas

2. **Classical Mechanics**

    Understanding the basic principles of Newtonian mechanics is essential to understanding the physical world. We recommend these books:

    - _Classical Mechanics_ by Herbert Goldstein
    - _An Introduction to Mechanics_ by Daniel Kleppner and Robert Kolenkow
    - _Lectures on Classical Dynamics_ by David Tong

3. **Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics**

    The study of energy and entropy, and the behavior of large numbers of particles, respectively. We recommend these books:

    - _Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach_ by Yunus A. Çengel and Michael A. Boles
    - _Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics_ by Herbert B. Callen
    - _Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations_ by Werner Krauth

4. **Electricity and Magnetism**

    Electromagnetism is a fundamental force of the universe, and understanding it is essential to many topics in physics. We recommend these books:

    - _Introduction to Electrodynamics_ by David J. Griffiths
    - _Electricity and Magnetism_ by Edward M. Purcell
    - _Classical Electrodynamics_ by John David Jackson

5. **Quantum Mechanics**

    Quantum mechanics is the study of the behavior of matter and energy on a small scale. We recommend these books:

    - _Principles of Quantum Mechanics_ by R. Shankar
    - _Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals_ by Richard P. Feynman and Albert R. Hibbs
    - _Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications_ by Nouredine Zettili

6. **Special Relativity and General Relativity**

    Einstein's theories of relativity describe the behavior of objects in motion and the curvature of spacetime, respectively. We recommend these books:

    - _Spacetime Physics_ by Edwin F. Taylor and John Archibald Wheeler
    - _Special Relativity: For the Enthusiastic Beginner_ by David Morin
    - _Gravitation_ by Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne, and John Archibald Wheeler

## Study Plan

Here's a possible sequence for your study plan, based on the books above:

1. Start by reading the mathematics textbooks, starting with calculus and moving on to linear algebra and differential equations.

2. Move on to classical mechanics textbooks. This is a good place to start, as it builds on your understanding of calculus and gives you a basic understanding of physical systems.

3. Once you have a solid foundation in mechanics, move on to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. These are key topics for understanding the behavior of large systems of particles and energy.

4. After that, move on to electricity and magnetism. This is a complex topic, but a necessary one in physics, as it underlies many other topics in the field.

5. With your knowledge of mechanics and electromagnetism, you can then move on to quantum mechanics, which is an entirely different way of looking at the world.

6. Finally, once you have a good grasp of quantum mechanics, you can move on to special and general relativity, which describe the behavior of objects in motion and the curvature of spacetime.

This is just one possible study plan, though. You may find that you want to spend more or less time on certain topics, or that you want to study certain topics in a different order. The important thing is to have a plan and work through the material systematically.


* Addendum from Quora:

But, if you must, here's what I'd recommend, and likely in this order:
1. A good single-variable calculus text.  I can't recommend one, but I used Hughes-Hallet's.  Seems pretty specific to Arizona, though.
2. Halliday and Resnick/Halliday Resnick and Krane - Intro to physics, with calculus.  Go through both volumes.
3. Multivariable calculus.  You'll need it, trust me.
4. Marion's Classical Dynamics.  You need something between Halliday and Goldstein, and this is a popular one.
5. Griffiths' Electrodynamics.  A good intro to Maxwell's equations.
6. Lay - Linear Algebra
7. Hecht, Optics.  A classic, but not as dense as Born & Wolf.
8. Griffiths' Quantum Mechanics
9. Kittel and Kroemer - Thermal Physics
10. Arfken and Weber - Mathematical Methods for Physicists
11. Bevington and Robinson - Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences (I am an experimentalist, after all)
12. The Feynman Lectures on Physics (good as a reference and to deepen understanding)
13.

As for graduate school, even with a master's degree, at a bare minimum, you'll need (in no particular order):
1. Goldstein's Classical Mechanics
2. J.D. Jackson's Electrodynamics (the Big Red/Blue/Green Bible).  Fulvio Melia's companion text is also super-helpful in this study, but will not stand alone.
3. Sakurai's Quantum Mechanics
4. Huang's Statistical Mechanics, along with Frederick's intro in the subject
5. Rybicki & Lightman's work on Radiative Processes in Astrophysics (good for any radiation detection/simulation work)
